# D-MoE Code-Switching ASR Project

Forked from [ESPNET](https://github.com/espnet/espnet), this project focuses on developing a Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model  for **code-switching speech recognition**. The primary focus is improving the **audio encoder** to better handle the complexities of code-switching scenarios.

For more details on the methodologies and approaches, please refer to our papers:

- **ICASSP 2024**: [An Effective Mixture-Of-Experts Approach For Code-Switching Speech Recognition Leveraging Encoder Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17189)
- **SLT 2024**: [Enhancing Code-Switching ASR Leveraging Non-Peaky CTC Loss and Deep Language Posterior Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08651)

Some models reproducing results from these papers can be found in this repository.
