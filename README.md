# Code-Switching ASR Model Training

This repository is forked from [ESPNET](https://github.com/espnet/espnet). The primary goal of this project is to train specialized Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models for **code-switching speech recognition**, with a focus on improving the **acoustic encoder**.

## Publications
This project is aligned with the following research papers:

- **ICASSP 2024**: [An Effective Mixture-Of-Experts Approach For Code-Switching Speech Recognition Leveraging Encoder Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17189)
- **SLT 2024**: [Enhancing Code-Switching ASR Leveraging Non-Peaky CTC Loss and Deep Language Posterior Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08651)

Reproduced models for some of the above research are available in my repository.

## Installation Guide
Please follow the [ESPNET installation guide](https://espnet.github.io/espnet/installation.html) to set up the environment. Ensure you are using **Python 3.8**.
